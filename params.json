{"name":"Becky Boone","tagline":"Software Developer, Anchorage, AK","body":"## Not Paid Work\r\n### Anchorage Programming Workshop\r\n[Website](anchorageprogramming.org)  \r\nCo-founded Anchorage's organization to promote women in technology. We teach beginning programming concepts for free to all women who are interested. I feel strongly that programming should be as pervasive as writing skills. Women should not be left behind. \r\n  \r\n### Code For Anchorage\r\nStarted Anchorage's brigade for [Code for America](codeforamerica.com). I was inspired by Anchorage's amazing Chief Technology Officer, Lance Ahern, when he motivated us to join the Race for Reuse. Which we did very well in, check out their [annual report](http://annual.codeforamerica.org/). It was supposed to highlight Anchorage's team, but somehow I got all the glory.\r\n\r\n### Anchorage Commuter Challenge\r\n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ResourceDataInc/commuter_challenge)  \r\nRails app to support the Bicycle Commuters of Anchorage's [Commuter Challenge](commuterchallenge.bicycleanchorage.org).\r\n\r\n## Paid Work\r\n### Resource Data, Inc\r\n#### Sr. Programmer / Analyst\r\n##### (April 2011 - Present)\r\nThis decent sized local consulting company taught me about GIS and how to work in a team.\r\n* Ruby, C#, ActionScript\r\n* Rails, ASP .NET, Flex, ArcGIS API for Flex, Caliburn.Micro\r\n* SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle 10g\r\n* Custom SharePoint Development (the first rule of SharePoint development is don't talk about SharePoint development)\r\n\r\n### Design-PT\r\n#### Software Developer\r\n##### (July 2009 – March 2011)\r\nThis small startup taught me self-reliance and how to be a jack of all trades. **Static html website update?** Sure! **Custom CMS (why?) maintenance?** Of course! **Custom Drupal module?** If you insist. **Pick your own technology tutoring site?** Rails!
